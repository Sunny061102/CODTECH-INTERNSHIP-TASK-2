A to-do list can help you organize your time and finish your tasks more efficiently, giving you more free time. Plan out each task, along with the time it may reasonably take. If you're honest with yourself and commit to your schedule, you can find more time to relax and enjoy your hobbies.

* Focusing on one task at a time: Avoid multitasking and distractions by focusing on one task at a time.
